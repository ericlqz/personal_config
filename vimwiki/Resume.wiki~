                    Project Name: ARP Cheater and Sniffer in LAN
                    This project aims to provide two network tools which can work in LAN. The ARP 
                    Cheater can send fake ARP message onto a Local Area Network, aim to 
                    associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of default 
                    gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to 
                    the attacker instead. While the  Sniffer can capture each packet and 
                    decode the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in 
                    packet, and analyzes its content.

                    This project aims to develope a LBS(Localed Based Software) application
                    to provide life search service. Mainly including traffic, map, locating
                    search and so on. I was responsible for traffic service, map service, 
                    and user service. Traffic service  provide transfer, drive, walk and bus 
                    query. Map service provide tiled map service which based on Mercator 
                    Coordinate System, and load various search result onto map. User Service
                    supports user login and regist operations.
