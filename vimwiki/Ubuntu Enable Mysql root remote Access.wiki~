Ubuntu installs Mysql at /etc/mysql/ by default. Now we need to set a root password.

mysql -u root
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'ROOT'@'LOCALHOST"
> = PASSWORD('new_password');

Now while we’re still here, we’ll create a new HOST for root and allow root to login from anywhere.

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . *(no blank) TO 'root'@'%'
> IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit

Thanks to Thom for the Flush Privileges comment.  I think it depends on other settings in your MySQL setup, since I didn’t have to, but just in case, I’ve added it here.  We’re almost done now. We just have to tell Mysql to allow remote logins.

sudo vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

Out-of-the-box, MySQL only allows connections from the localhost identified by the IP Address of 127.0.0.1.  We need to remove that restriction, so find the line that says

bind-address = 127.0.0.1

and comment it out.
