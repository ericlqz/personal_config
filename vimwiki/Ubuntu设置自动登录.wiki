To boot into text mode

sudo vim /etc/default/grub

and change the following line:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
exit and enter:

 sudo update-grub
Automatically login in text mode without specifying userid or password

Add -a <your-user-name> to the line:

exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1
in file /etc/init/tty1.conf

like so:

exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty6 -a gruber
/etc/init/tty1.conf is the upstart job that runs at the appropriate time to start the terminal session on tty1. Adding the -a option tells getty to call the login program with the -f option to sign that user in, bypassing the user prompt from getty and the password prompt from login.

Upstart is the Ubuntu system that operates as the kernel init process (process 1).
