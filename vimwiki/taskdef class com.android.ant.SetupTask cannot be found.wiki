Problem:
When use ant to build the android project, we got the error:
taskdef class com.android.ant.SetupTask cannot be found.
It means that the sdk path isnot find by the ant.

Solution:
1. check if the local.property file exist or not.
If not, create the file, and write this sentence:

  sdk.dir=/home/eric/development/android-sdk-linux

The path depends on your sdk path.

2. update your android project.
android update project -p <path to your project>

3. rebuild your project, it should work.
